		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>This portfolio includes my work in Mrs. Ashish's Web Design Class and my refelction for each unit.</p>
<hr/>

	<h4>Unit 2 - Creating Web Pages with HTML</h4>
	<h4>Modules</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Module 1: Pre-Coding</li>
	<li>Module 2: Basic HTML Markup</li>
	<li>Module 3: HTML Lists</li>
	<li>Module 4: Creating Lists</li>
	<li>Module 5: Creating a Data Table</li>
	<li>Module 6: HTML Video</li>
	<li>Module 7: Reflections</li>
	</ul>
<p> Durring this unit, I was able to better understand how to use the table tag and in turn was able to create a better more functional layout for the table to show or convey information. Also, with that I learned how to use a separate CSS page inorder to do all of my styling for the webpages. With the external CSS page I learnend how to control and manage the padding on the body, margins, borders, and background colors all from one place. But in order for the external CSS to be of use I first had to link it to all of the pages. </p>

	<h4>Unit 3 - CSS</h4>
	<h4>Modules</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Module 1: Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets </li>
	<li>Module 2: Color in CSS</li>
	<li>Module 3: Typography in CSS</li>
	<li>Module 4: The Box Model in CSS</li>
	<li>Module 5: The Role of ID and Class in CSS</li>
	<li>Module 6: Page Layout Techniques </li>
	<li>Module 7: Reflections</li>
	</ul>
<p> In this unit we were able to go further in depth with the styling in general. For example there are two ways to style your document, one beign in text styling which is done on the same page as the document or the second way is with an external style sheet. I currently am using an external style sheet to do all of my styling which includes changing text colors and making a navigation menu just to name a couple. The CSS plays a huge role in the making of a website since without it it would be all plain text. </p>

	<h4>Unit 4</h4>
	<h4>Modules</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Module 1: Introduction to Web Graphics </li>
	<li>Module 2: Creating a Web Photo Album</li>
	<li>Module 3: Creating a Button</li>
	<li>Module 4: Creating a Web Page Banner</li>
	<li>Module 5:  Reflections</li>
	</ul>
	<p> In this Unit we learned how to optimize and and rezize images using image editing software. Not only that we also learned a little bit of background on how image formats were first used, such as JPEG, PNJ, and GIF. We learned how to use layers on the images so that we can add separte components to the image to edit thwt will not affect the whole image as a whole. In clas we also learned about the favicon, which is short for favorite icon and is displayed on the tab of the web page as a little image to add a bit of personaliztion to the site. But some of the limitions of the favicon include that is is limited to the small size of 16 by 16 pixels. What this means is that whatever design wanted cannot be too complax and has to stay fairly simple and basic. I was able to design my favicon with a few layers and a few colors. </p>

	<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<p> In this unit we learned how to use scripts and Java script to better our website. We were able to learn the difference between server-side and client-side scripting, and spent some time developing a general idea of how server-side scripting works.  Most of the concepts are taught by examining real world websites, and discussing how site developers have done what they've done. In the early days of the web, most web pages were static pages with very little or no interactivity. </p>

		<h4>Unit 6</h4>
			<p> In this unit you are introduced to the concept of quality control. Quality control is a process that applies to all sorts of goods and services. Whenever a product is produced or service is provided, it is important for the product or service to be of good quality. This concept applies to websites just as it applies to other products. Quality control can involve very detailed and sophisticated analyses of the process by which websites are produced, but it can also be a relatively simple process of simply testing the quality of the website you've created. Websites can be tested using automated tools that validate websites or check them for errors, or they can be manually tested by observing actual users interacting with the site.</p>
